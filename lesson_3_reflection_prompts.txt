When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I would that when working in team with other people so that everyone can access the rep.
And I would do that, privately, for private projects which need to be safer.
Having the project in the cloud can help me with that.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because otherwise you could not stay up to date with what is goint on.
Maybe a colleague made some changes that affected your code.
You would have it changed without realizing it.
