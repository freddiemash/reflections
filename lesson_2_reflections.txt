What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A .git folder is created into the folder I am initializing. We need to do it in order to start tracking the history of the files in the folder.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

It let you control what to move into the repository. It does not have commit tracking though.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
For sure they can help when there is a production version of the code and a development version.
We can develop what needed on a branch and only when ready to go, we will merge stuff.


How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

They are helpful in order to realize how the development is proceeding.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?

It is clear to me why. Let's move on.
